# GPT Summary API

An API made with Flask that will take in a user's prompt in order to summarize a web page using OpenAI's ChatGPT. The user's input can either be a link or a keyword search. In the case of a user keyword search, the top result from Google will be chosen.

This project will also include a Vue.js web app that will allow the user to interact with our API.
